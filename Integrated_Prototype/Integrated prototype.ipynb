        "\n",
        "The goal of this section is to build a simple yet effective conversational AI assistant that can handle a natural, multi-turn dialogue with the user. It uses OpenAI’s GPT-4o, the most up-to-date large language model I have access to, to generate relevant and coherent responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup uses LangChain’s `ConversationChain` combined with `ConversationBufferMemory`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps track of what the user says in each turn so that the assistant can remember the flow of the conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `ConversationChain` passes each user query, along with the stored memory, to the LLM - so follow-up questions can build on previous answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "I specifically chose GPT-4o because it is the latest version with a more recent knowledge cutoff (2023) than older GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models, which means it can provide more relevant, up-to-date general context when talking about broad topics like global AI governance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Result:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The result is an interactive AI assistant bot that you can chat with by typing your questions. It can handle coherent turns and the conversation runs until you type exit to end it.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `👤 User` shows the user input.\n",
        "\n",
        "And the `🤖 Assistant` shows the bot's response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of AI policy and governance, this kind of conversational interface can help:\n",
        "\n",
        "Students, researchers, or policymakers explore broad concepts around AI governance and global strategies in a conversational way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Test ideas and follow-up questions without needing to search multiple sources manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "Serve as a prototype for how a real policy chatbot could assist with simple clarifications, explanations, or brainstorming sessions.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this version only uses the general LLM, the same conversational memory approach can later be combined with document retrieval (RAG) or live tools to make the assistant more factual and context-specific. We will explore this in the next section of this notebook."

        "The goal of this section is to demonstrate how combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with conversational memory can make a language model more reliable when answering questions that require accurate, domain-specific information — in this case, AI governance.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "https://file.go.gov.sg/nais2023.pdf\n",
        "\n",
        "With Generative AI advancing so quickly, strong governance frameworks are more important than ever to manage risks like ethics, privacy, fairness, and accountability. Singapore’s National AI Strategy 2.0 (AI for Public Good) is a practical example of how a country is putting clear principles and safeguards in place to make sure AI benefits everyone while minimising potential harm. That makes it a meaningful document to test how an AI assistant can help people navigate complex policy information.\n",
        "\n",
        "I chose this document because it ties directly to my research on Generative AI risk assessment, supply chain dynamics, and regulatory compliance. I focused on the introduction, the strategic pillars of the strategy, and especially System 3: Infrastructure & Environment, which sets out how Singapore is building the trusted environment and infrastructure needed for safe, responsible AI development and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "By focusing on these sections, I can make sure the assistant retrieves meaningful, policy-relevant information — not just generic or unrelated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- The selected pages are loaded and divided into smaller, meaningful text chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Each chunk is embedded and stored in a vector database, enabling semantic search.\n",
        "\n",
        "- For each user question, the system searches for the most relevant chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Conversational Retrieval Chain combines these retrieved sections with the conversation history, allowing the assistant to keep track of previous questions and provide consistent answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The language model then generates a final response that uses the retrieved content and the chat history to generate clear, factual answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Result:**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two types of outcomes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The assistant can handle direct, single-turn semantic queries, providing clear, factual answers based on the policy document. For example, I tested questions such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - “What shifts is Singapore making from its first AI strategy to NAIS 2.0?”\n",
        "\n",
        "  - “What is AI Verify and how does it support AI governance?”\n",
        "\n",
        "  - “What is Singapore’s role in international AI governance efforts?”\n",
        "\n",
        "These in-line queries show how the system retrieves the most relevant sections of the document and generates precise, contextual responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It also works as an interactive conversational assistant, where users can input follow-up questions in a multi-turn dialogue. The conversational memory ensures that the assistant keeps track of what has already been discussed, providing continuity and context across multiple queries - similar to how a real policy advisor might respond.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these capabilities demonstrate how retrieval and memory can work hand in hand to make an AI assistant more accurate, context-aware, and useful for engaging with detailed governance frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Application:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach directly supports the Trusted Environment pillar of Singapore’s AI strategy by showing how complex policy information can be made more accessible and useful to the people who need it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, a tool like this could be used by:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Policy teams and civil servants, who may need quick answers to detailed questions about AI risk levels, governance frameworks, or compliance measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Businesses and citizens, who want to better understand how national AI policies affect their work or daily lives.\n",
        "\n",
        "Companies developing AI systems, who can use it to check that their solutions align with national guidelines on privacy, fairness, and accountability.\n",
        "\n",
        "By combining retrieval with conversational memory, this assistant helps translate policy documents into practical, understandable information — supporting Singapore’s goal of promoting AI for the public good."

        "A detailed explanation for each image, together with the image itself, is included in the Capstone Report document.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, from all the results combined, the **key general observations** are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Specific details shape realism**: Adding precise technical details — such as camera specifications (“Canon EOS R5, 50mm lens at f/1.4”) or lighting conditions (“golden hour natural light”) — produces more realistic depth of field, highlights, and shadows. This makes it much easier for the model to replicate the look and feel of real photography when clear, technical cues are included.\n",
        "2. **Diffusion bias on human faces, even with artistic styles**: When art styles like “impressionist style,” “oil painting,” or “visible brushstrokes” are used, clear textural changes are visible in the background and props — but the human face often remains relatively photorealistic. This is likely because human faces are one of the most overrepresented patterns in training data, so models “learn” to render them smooth, symmetrical, and well-lit by default. To truly stylize the face, you must explicitly prompt for the artistic effect to apply to the subject’s facial features too.\n",
        "3. **Negative prompts effectively control distractions**: Instructions such as “no clutter,” “no background people,” and “no pets” are powerful for removing unwanted elements and keeping the scene focused. This shows how prompt engineering can constrain a diffusion model’s generative “autopilot” and reduce irrelevant filler details.\n",
        "4. **Angle and perspective influence more than just viewpoint**: For example, when the “overhead shot” angle was specified, the book naturally shifted from the table to the woman’s lap. This demonstrates that perspective instructions shape not only the camera viewpoint but also the subject’s pose and the spatial arrangement of props within the scene.\n",
        "5. **Mood descriptors strengthen visual storytelling**: Descriptive phrases like “cozy café,” “peaceful quiet mood,” and “vintage décor” guide the model’s choices in colours, props, textures, and light placement. This results in more cohesive and believable compositions.\n",
        "6. **Simple prompts invite default assumptions**: When prompts are vague — for example, “a person reading a book in a café” — the model tends to fill in common stereotypes, such as adding extra people, coffee cups, or generic cluttered backgrounds. More specific details help steer the output away from these generic defaults and reduce the influence of training data bias.\n",
        "7. **Lack of diversity in subjects**: Throughout these tests, the generated images consistently portrayed the “young woman” as fair-skinned, slim, and conventionally attractive, despite no explicit mention of race, body type, or appearance. This highlights the persistence of demographic bias and shows that prompts alone are often insufficient to produce diverse or representative outputs without intentional, explicit instructions.\n",
        "8. **Stylization does not override default identity cues**: Switching to “storybook illustration,” “oil painting,” or “vintage vibe” changes the style of the background and environment, but the woman’s appearance remains largely the same — modern, casual clothing, minimal variation in facial features, and only slight changes in colour palette. This illustrates how strongly the model defaults to familiar, generic identity templates for humans.\n",
        "9. **Order and structure of the prompt matters**: The sequence of words can affect which parts the model focuses on first. Putting subject first, then scene elements, then style or medium, tends to yield more consistent results. Example prompt structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "`[Subject] + [Setting] + [Time of day] + [Lighting] + [Props] + [Mood] + [Style/Medium] + [Technical details] + [Negatives]`\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Importance for AI Policy and Regulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These observations underscore why transparent prompt design, systematic content auditing, and clear documentation are so essential when deploying generative AI tools, especially those capable of creating realistic human representations. Subtle patterns in the training data can easily reinforce stereotypes and cultural defaults without users even realising it. This has direct implications for fairness, accountability, and trust in AI systems.\n",
        "From a governance perspective, it becomes clear that effective AI regulation should address not only how these models are trained and used, but also how the outputs are monitored for bias, representation, and unintended patterns. As more industries adopt generative AI, whether for creative work, communications, or policy support, the need for explainability, diversity-aware prompt engineering, and human oversight will be critical to ensure that AI-generated content reflects real-world values and serves the public good.\n",
